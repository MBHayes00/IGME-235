## 2. Genre
Wave-management, shoot-em-up, action/tactical game. The game will fall more towards the tactical side since the player will be unable to move, only rotate. 

## 3. Platform
The platform will mainly be oriented around desktop. The primary controls will be the mouse and mouse buttons.

## 4. Story
Grandma Dawn got her recipe wrong, and now the demonic gingerbread men are reeking havoc. Only grandma can clean up the mess she created.
Equipped with only her trusty shotgun and some baking supplies, she'll send the gingerbread men back to the hellhole they spawned from.
      
## 5. Aesthetics
The aesthetic will mainly be stylized and cartoonish. Although it is a shooter game, the style will be more light-hearted, but with a hint of dread and spookiness. The music will have a similar feeling. Similar to happy songs that are played in a minor key to make it feel ominous. 

## 6a. Gameplay
The player will be stationary and will only be able to rotate. From there, the player will be able shoot at the gingerbread and can place traps around the map to hinder the enemy's progression.

## 6b. Controls
Mouse: Moving the mouse will rotate the grandma

Left-Button: Fires gun

Right-Button: Places traps at the mouse's position

## 6c. Player Learning
At the beginning of the game, there will a brief tutorial in order to get the player aquitted with the controls. The initial waves will start off slow allowing the players to further get use to the feel the game. Eventually the enemies will increase creating a harder progression and challenge.
